<p>This is a community-driven taco recipe repo. Please fork and submit your own recipes, because the more there are, the more delicious it gets. I'll probably write more here soon.</p>

<p>This repository contains a few different directories:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/full_tacos">full tacos</a>
<ul><li>this contains full descriptions of tacos. those tacos may contain additional elements from other directories.</li></ul></li>
<li><a href="/base_layers">base layers</a>
<ul><li>this is where you'll find meats, beans, tofu, and other things that make up the 'base' of your taco goodness.</li></ul></li>
<li><a href="/mixins">mixins</a>
<ul><li>the base is important, but what you add to it is what makes the taco glow.</li></ul></li>
<li><a href="/condiments">condiments</a>
<ul><li>do you make a motherfucking <em>salsa</em>? do you know how to pickle your own jalape√±os? yeah, put it here.</li></ul></li>
<li><a href="/seasonings">seasonings</a>
<ul><li>hot and spicy? rubs and mixes? it's all in here.</li></ul></li>
<li><a href="/shells">shells</a>
<ul><li>your base layers and mixins and condiments have to go <em>into</em> something, right? put your tortilla recipes here.</li></ul></li>
<li><a href="/like_tacos">like_tacos</a>
<ul><li>a collection of things that are like tacos, e.g. gua bao.</li></ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Community assistance in growing the number of directories, or in better organizing or whatever is more more more than welcome. </p>

<p>Looking for restaurants and taco joints? This repo's about recipes, but if you'd like to help find great places to eat tacos, join <a href="http://github.com/hunterowens/the_great_taco_hunt">the_great_taco_hunt</a>, a repo dedicated to documenting great taco locations.</p>

<h2>Full Index</h2>

<p>This is too important not to be properly indexed. Please add your entry to this index when submitting so the world can get taco greatness without having to fish through a bunch of folders. </p>

<p><a href="INDEX.md">Full Index</a></p>

<h2>Notes on Writing &amp; Naming Conventions</h2>

<ul>
<li>For ease, please write your recipes in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">markdown</a>, and give your files the .md extension.</li>
<li>If you are creating a <a href="/full_tacos">full taco</a>, be sure to also create the related <a href="/base_layers">base layer</a> ingredient and <a href="/mixins">mixins</a> that go in it. Link to those individual recipes within your <a href="/full_tacos">full taco</a> to create object-oriented taco goodness.</li>
<li>Once you have created all your various taco objects (even if it's just one) update the <a href="INDEX.md">index</a> so that it gets listed. While we do have people checking every now and then, <em>you can help keep the index up-to-date</em> by updating your stuff as part of your pull request.</li>
<li>Please name your files with underscores_in_place_of_spaces so that links remain readable and aren't%20full%20of%20bullshit. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Endnotes</h2>

<p>This whole thing was hastily assembled on a cold November evening with the warmth of some steak, sweet potato, and apple tacos aglow in my belly.</p>
