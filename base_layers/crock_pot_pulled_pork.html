<h1>Crock Pot Pulled Pork</h1>

<p>This is the base of my very favorite tacos. Added bonus is by cooking these all day in a slow cooker, your house smells <em>amazing</em>.</p>

<p>Note: Unless you're cooking for a dozen people, you're going to end up with a lot of leftover pork, but that's about the best problem you can possibly have.</p>

<p>GET GOING EARLY–in a perfect world, you're gonna give this thing at least eight hours on low.</p>

<ul>
<li>2-3 pound hunk of pork shoulder.</li>
<li>chili powder</li>
<li>mexican oregano (dried)</li>
<li>ground cumin</li>
<li>medium-sized onion (or, a couple shallots)</li>
<li>can of green chilies, diced</li>
<li>pepper &amp; salt</li>
</ul>

<p>Chop up your onion or shallot into small bits–you don't want big loops of onion, dice it.</p>

<p>Rub your hunk of pork generously with chili powder, oregano, pepper, salt, and a pinch or two of cumin. I tend to try and have a very light crust of this stuff on the outside of the pork.</p>

<p>Toss the hunk of pork, the onions, and the green chilis into the crock pot, set that sucker to LOW, and let it slow cook. I try to get mine in by 9am so I can eat around 6pm. If you're pressed for time, you can do this in about four hours on high, but the deliciousness factor is lowered.</p>

<p>Once the time is up, either shred the thing up in the crock pot or, if you can actually get it out without it falling apart, get it into a bowl and shred from there. That way, you're getting it out of what ends up being a GIGANTIC AMOUNT of juices. But again: oh no, your pork ended up sitting in a big vat of juice–we all weep for you.</p>
