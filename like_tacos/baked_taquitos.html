<h1>Baked Taquitos</h1>

<p>Baked, not fried. Flour tortillas, not corn. <em>THE HORROR</em>. But seriously, these are super tasty and really, really kid-friendly. Adapted from <a href="http://www.chef-in-training.com/2012/02/baked-creamy-chicken-taquitos/">this basic recipe</a>.</p>

<p>I almost always double this recipe and make a couple dozen at a time.</p>

<ul>
<li>12-15 soft-taco size flour tortillas</li>
<li>Cooking spray/light oil</li>
<li>Kosher salt</li>
<li>2 cups <a href="/base_layers/basic_shredded_chicken.md">shredded chicken</a></li>
<li>1 cup shredded cheese (colby jack works great)</li>
<li>3 oz. cream cheese</li>
<li>1/4 cup green salsa (the little can of Herdez works great, or <a href="/condiments/simple_salsa_verde.md">make your own</a>)</li>
<li>Lime juice to taste</li>
<li>1 tsp chili powder</li>
<li>1/2 tsp cumin</li>
<li>1/2 tsp onion powder</li>
<li>2 Cloves minced garlic</li>
<li>2 Sliced green onions</li>
</ul>

<p>I have kids who are afraid of green things in their food. (I favor the whiter portions of the green onions.) If you do not live under such a regime, feel free to add <em>2 Tbsp chopped cilantro</em>.</p>

<p>Although it really doesn't need it.</p>

<p>In a large mixing bowl, pop your cream cheese into the microwave for 20-30 seconds to soften it. Then add the salsa, lime juice, chili powder, cumin, onion powder and garlic. Stir into a slurry, fold in the green onions and cilantro if you're going that way, then add the chicken and cheese. Mix well. (You can do all this in advance and keep the mix in the fridge for taquito time.)</p>

<p>Once you're ready to bake, preheat your oven to 425 degrees and line a baking sheet with foil.</p>

<p>Warm your package of tortillas in the microwave for 45 seconds or so, so they're pliable. To construct the taquitos, add 2-3 tablespoons of filling onto a tortilla, fold the tortilla over top, then use your fingers to pull the filling back toward you underneath the top half of the tortilla. You should end up with a nice, tight "tube" of filling at about the 1/3 point of the tortilla, so roll forward as tightly as you can to create the taquito cylinder.</p>

<p>Place each taquito, seam-side down, onto your baking sheet. They shouldn't touch each other. Once they're all in place, hit the tops with a bit of cooking spray (I use the butter-flavored stuff, but you could also just lightly mop with a paper towel and some oil). Sprinkle the taquitos with a bit of kosher salt, then bake for approximately 20 minutes. Just look for golden-brown and delicious.</p>

<p>Rock out with plenty of things to dip these in: salsa, sour cream, guacamole.</p>
